Key deliverables included design, deployment, implementation, installation, configuration and testing. We ensured all prerequisites in terms of system requirements and environment setup were met. Next, we carried out the installation and configuration of applications, including an Nginx Ingress Controller, an SSL/TLS Certificate Manager, Jira Data Center, persistent storage, database. We also implemented horizontal scaling of the product. All in all, the Data Center was deployed with ease and efficiency, and the client was extremely appreciative of our professionalism and expertise."

The solution was to be capable of supporting millions of simultaneous viewers for one streamer while also being able to scale deployments down to fit the current load. The audience can also share the stream to other platforms such as Zoom, LinkedIn, and Google Meet. We built the infrastructure on AWS and leveraged the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as the foundation for our solution. The scaler included an Nginx Ingress Controller, an SSL/TLS Certificate Manager, an AWS Aurora database, a MediaSoup server, AWS EFS and EBS persistent storage, and a Helm chart. As the cherry on top, we included horizontal scaling with HPA and cluster autoscaler, and continuous deployment with GitOps using ArgoCD. In the end, the scaler exceeded the client’s expectations and continues to bring immense value to the end users.."

This event-driven autoscaling solution extends the feature set of K8S’ HPA and scales Selenium browser nodes based on the number of requests waiting in the session queue. We built the infrastructure on AWS and leveraged the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as the foundation for our solution. The scaler included an Nginx Ingress Controller, a Selenium Grid 4 proxy server, a combination of On-Demand and Spot instances for cost optimization, and a solution to record testing videos per session and upload them to S3 for storage. Scaling by the number of tests in queue with the testing framework was done by combining with the cluster autoscaler. The scaler works perfectly at massive scale, and the client was extremely happy with the end result."
